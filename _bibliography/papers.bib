abstract={Recent advancements in quantum photonics have driven significant 
progress in photonic quantum computing (PQC), addressing challenges in scalability, 
efficiency, and fault tolerance. Experimental efforts have focused on integrated photonic
 platforms utilizing materials such as silicon photonics and lithium niobate to enhance 
performance. Parameters like photon loss rates, coupling efficiencies, and fidelities 
have been pivotal, with state-of-the-art systems achieving coupling efficiencies above 90% 
and photon indistinguishability exceeding 99%. Quantum error correction schemes have reduced 
logical error rates to below , marking a step toward fault-tolerant PQC. Photon generation has 
also advanced with deterministic sources, such as quantum dots, achieving brightness levels 
exceeding  photon pairs/s/mW and time-bin encoding enabling scalable entanglement. Heralded 
single-photon sources now exhibit purities above 99%, driven by innovations in fabrication 
techniques. High-efficiency photon detectors, such as superconducting nanowire single-photon 
detectors (SNSPDs), have demonstrated detection efficiencies exceeding 98%, dark count rates 
below 1 Hz, and timing jitters as low as 15 ps, ensuring precise photon counting and manipulation. 
Moreover, demonstrations of boson sampling with over 100 photons underscore the growing computational 
power of photonic systems, surpassing classical limits. The integration of machine learning has optimized 
photonic circuit design, while frequency multiplexing and time-bin encoding have increased system scalability. 
Together, these advances bridge the gap between theoretical potential and practical implementation, positioning 
PQC as a transformative technology for computing, communication, and quantum sensing.},

coupled with machine learning, the study explores the electronic, optical,

abstract={Drilling operations in Basra's oil fields, particularly 
targeting the Dammam, Hartha, and Shuaiba formations, are facing 
significant challenges related to lost circulation. This study 
investigates the effects of incorporating lost circulation materials 
(LCMs) into bentonite-based and polymer-based drilling muds. 
Experiments were carried out using a high-pressure high-temperature 
filter press to evaluate the rheological properties and filtration 
performance of the different mud systems prepared using bentonite 
and polymer mixed with various compositions of additives. 
The results showed that the incorporation of LCMs increased 
the plastic viscosity and yield point of the polymer mud by 25-30%, 
while the impact on the bentonite mud was less significant. Notably, 
the using of fine-sized LCMs influenced the rheological characteristics 
of the polymer mud system, resulting in a 35-40% increase in parameters 
as the LCM concentration was raised. In terms of filtration performance, 
the bentonite mud exhibited the highest total fluid loss, whereas the polymer 
mud showed the lowest. The adding of LCMs led to a 20-25% reduction in fluid 
loss for both mud systems, with fine-sized LCMs at higher concentrations 
proving most effective in the polymer mud. In conclusion, this study 
demonstrates the substantial influence that the type, size, and concentration 
of LCMs can have on the rheological and filtration properties of drilling muds. 
It is confirmed that the polymer mud system is particularly sensitive to these 
LCM parameters. Desalination elimination of 80.95% associated with a maximum

abstract={Chelating agents such as Ethylene-Diamine-Tetra-Acetic 
(EDTA) had been suggested to be a newly designed biodegradable filter 
cake breakers that could enhance efficiency in filter cake removal. 
This chelate-based fluid had been proven to effectively dissolved 
the bridging agent in the filter cake which was calcium carbonate 
causing the removal of the filter cake to be successful. Besides 
that, the ability of the chelating agents to provide low corrosion 
potential made chelating agent as a great alternative for live mineral 
acids. This provided less aquatic toxicity, more human and environment 
friendly and readily. However, traditional EDTA cannot performance well 
in the high-pressure, high-temperature (HPHT) wellbore environments. 
Therefore, in this study, we explore the use of Titanium-enhanced 
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (Ti-EDTA) as a novel chemical breaker 
for the decomposition of filter cakes formed in high-pressure, 
high-temperature (HPHT) wellbore environments. Using ab initio 
molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations within the Quantum Espresso 
framework version 7.2, we examine the molecular interactions, atomic 
displacements, and thermodynamic behavior of Ti-EDTA in contact with 
synthetic-based mud (SBM) residues. The simulations track the structural 
evolution of Ti-EDTA during filter cake decomposition, revealing significant 
molecular rearrangements and enhanced solubility of the filter cakes. 
Compared to traditional EDTA-based and silica-based breakers, 
Ti-EDTA shows improved potential energy and particle mobility, 
indicative of greater decomposition efficiency. Our results indicate 
that EDTA resulted in a more negative potential energy of −1035 Ry 
signifying a stable system, whereas Ti-EDTA simulation yielded a 
less stable system with a value of −935 Ry energy. The atomic interactions 
at both levels indicated that Ti-EDTA possesses higher temperature by 
16000 K and with a coupled higher potential energy makes an effective 
chemical to enhance decomposition reactions. For a higher rate of 
potential energy, temperature and volume, Ti-EDTA molecule best beats 
EDTA in terms AIMD simulated efficiency. The integration of titanium 
ions into the EDTA structure significantly boosted the simulation 
performance, making it a promising candidate for environmentally 
friendly wellbore cleanup applications. The study provides insights 
into the molecular mechanisms driving filter cake degradation and 
sets the stage for future experimental validation of Ti-EDTA's 
efficacy in field operations.},

  abstract={Accurate multiphase flowing bottom-hole pressure prediction 
within wellbores is a critical requirement to improve tube design and 
production optimization. Existing models often struggle to achieve reliable 
accuracy across the full range of operational conditions encountered in 
oil and gas wells. This can lead to misallocating resources during well design, 
inefficient production strategies resulting in lost revenue, increased risk of 
wellbore damage, and poorly informed investment decisions. 
This research presents a data-driven hybrid 
approach that uses a Radial Basis 
Function Neural Network and a Particle Swarm Optimization 
algorithm to construct an automated hybrid machine learning model. 
The proposed model was compared with several well-established 
machine learning models in the literature using the same computational framework. 
The modeling results demonstrated the superiority of the hybrid approach. 
The model achieved superior performance with lower errors, as evidenced by a 
Relative Root Mean Squared Error (RRMSE) of 0.055. Furthermore, the model exhibited 
a low level of uncertainty throughout the analysis, indicating its high degree of 
reliability. These findings suggest the proposed data-driven approach offers a robust

abstract={Designing drilling mud rheology is a complex task, particularly 
when it comes to preventing filter cakes from obstructing formation pores and 
making sure they can be easily decomposed using breakers. Incorporating both 
multiphysics and data-driven numerical simulations into the design of mud rheology 
experiments creates an additional challenge due to their symmetrical integration. 
In this computational intelligence study, we introduced numerical validation techniques 
using 498 available datasets from mud rheology and images from filter cakes. The goal was to 
symmetrically predict flow, maximize filtration volume, monitor void spaces, and evaluate 
formation damage occurrences. A neural-objective and image optimization approach to drilling 
mud rheology automation was employed using an artificial neural network feedforward (ANN-FF) 
function, a non-ANN-FF function, an image processing tool, and an objective optimization tool. 
These methods utilized the Google TensorFlow Sequential API-DNN architecture, MATLAB-nftool, 
the MATLAB-image processing tool, and a single-objective optimization algorithm. However, the 
analysis emanating from the ANN-FF and non-ANN-FF (with neurons of 10, 12, and 18) indicated that, 
unlike non-ANN-FF, ANN-FF obtained the highest correlation coefficient of 0.96–0.99. Also, 
the analysis of SBM and OBM image processing revealed a total void area of 1790 M µm2 and 1739 M µm2, 
respectively. Both SBM and OBM exhibited notable porosity and permeability that contributed to the 
enhancement of the flow index. Nonetheless, this study did reveal that the experimental-informed 
single objective analysis impeded the filtration volume; hence, it demonstrated potential formation damage. 
It is, therefore, consistent to note that automating flow predictions from mud rheology and filter 
cakes present an alternative intelligence method for non-programmers to optimize drilling productive time.},

of nanoparticles on interfacial tension and water-oil surface contact were examined in this study. 
The horizontal column was filled with low-porosity sand, and the nanopowders were suspended in 
deionized water. The four distinct nanoparticle suspension pore volumes (PV) used in this 
experiment are 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 PV. At the column's output, the sample is then deposited, 
and the effluent is analysed and contrasted using IFT and viscosity with a solid viscometer. 
In this investigation, it was discovered that the water target zone had a very limited pore volume 
and only received 0.52 PV of injected nanoparticles. The better the oil can be extracted, the lower 
the viscosity and IFT value. The removal of the oil droplet and increased oil output for EOR could 
result from the transport of PVP nanoparticles coated with aluminium.},

abstract={Locating petroleum-productive wells using informed geological data, a conventional means, has proven to be 
tedious and undesirable by reservoir engineers. The former numerical simulator required a lengthy trial-and-error process 
to manipulate the variables and uncertainties that lie on the reservoir to determine the best placement of the well. Hence, 
this paper examines the use of a global genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize the placement of wells in complex reservoirs, 
rather than relying on gradient-based (GB) methods. This is because GB approaches are influenced by the solution’s surface 
gradient and may only reach local optima, as opposed to global optima. Complex reservoirs have rough surfaces with high 
uncertainties, which hinders the traditional gradient-based method from converging to global optima. The explicit focus of 
this study was to examine the impact of various initial well placement distributions, the number of random solution sizes 
and the crossover rate on cumulative oil production, the optimization of the synthetic reservoir model created by CMG Builder, 
CMOST, and IMEX indicated that using a greater number of random solutions led to an increase in cumulative oil production. 
Despite the successful optimization, more generations are required to reach the optimal solution, while the application of 
GA on our synthetic model has proven efficient for well placement; however, different optimization algorithms such as the 
improved particle swarm (PSO) and grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithms could be used to redefine well-placement optimization in CMG.},

Measured depth (MD), Rate of penetration (ROP), 10-sec gel (GEL1), Plastic Viscosity (PV), Mud weight (MW), Yield point

abstract={Several technical factors contribute to the flow of cuttings from the wellbore to the surface of the well, 
some of which are fundamentally due to the speed and inclination of the drill pipe at different positions (concentric and eccentric), 
the efficacy of the drilling mud considers plastic viscosity (PV) and yield point (YP), the weight of the cuttings, and the 
deviation of the well. Moreover, these overlaying cutting beds breed destruction in the drilling operation, some of 
which cause stuck pipes, reducing the rate of rotation and penetration. This current study, while it addresses the 
apropos of artificial intelligence (AI) with symmetry, employs a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulation model 
to validate an effective synthetic-based mud-drilling and to investigate the potency of the muds’ flow behaviours for transporting 
cuttings. Furthermore, the study examines the ratio effects of YP/PV to attain the safe transport of cuttings based on the turbulence 
of solid-particle suspension from the drilling fluid and the cuttings, and its velocity–pressure influence in a vertical well under 
a concentric and eccentric position of the drilling pipe. The resulting CFD analysis explains that the YP/PV of SBM and OBM, which 
generated the required capacity to suspend the cuttings to the surface, are symmetric to the experimental results and hence, 
the position of the drill pipe at the concentric position in vertical wells required a lower rotational speed. A computational 
study of the synthetic-based mud and its potency of not damaging the wellbore under an eccentric drill pipe position can be further 
examined.},

and validating visual, multiphase flow under finite element analysis (FEA). The interactions of separate chemical 
breakers and drill-in-fluid such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), silica-nanoparticle (SiO2), and biodegradable 
synthetic-based mud drill-in-fluid (BSBMDIF) were monitored under a particle size distribution, viscosity, density, and 
pressure. Predicting return permeability of filter cake was considered under a simple filtration process. The particles’ 
deposition created pore spaces between them; barite 74 μm, nano-silica 150 nm, and EDTA 10 μm generally closed up the pores of 
the filtration medium. Under extreme drilling conditions, barite formed thicker regions, and EDTA chemical properties easily 
disjointed these particles, while SiO2 entirely did not. The experimented results of (EDTA) and SiO2 for return permeability 
were in full force agreeable with the 2D simulation. A hybrid computational analysis considering CFD under discrete element 
analysis and neural network can be employed for further research validations.},

abstract={Computer intelligent models are the order of the day for the manipulation of data to better 
understand the trend of complex situations under the questioned industry. The petroleum engineering is 
faced with multiple datasets from production logging tools and predictive analysis without these computer 
intelligent tools can be devastating. Errors of margins under these circumstances cannot be easily prevented, 
which may lead to some biases in the decision-making processes, thereby affecting the cost of operations and 
services in the industry. This study used an open-source dataset from a production well logging tool to evaluate 
and affirm the accuracy of a computer intelligent model, suitable for processing complex problems. However, 
an artificial neural network under the feedforward function and a model fitting-multilinear regression were 
used for this predictive analysis. Conclusively, the predictive analysis, whiles considering the coefficient of 
determination for these two models resulted that, the artificial neural network- feedforward function was better 
in predicting the flowing bottom-hole pressures than the multilinear regression. Multiphase flow under bottom-hole 
pressures can further be computed using CFD to determine variations of pressure drops, predicting flow patterns and 
geometry to enhance prudent decision-making analysis.},
