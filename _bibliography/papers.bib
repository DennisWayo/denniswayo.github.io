  abstract={Accurate multiphase flowing bottom-hole pressure prediction 
within wellbores is a critical requirement to improve tube design and 
production optimization. Existing models often struggle to achieve reliable 
accuracy across the full range of operational conditions encountered in 
oil and gas wells. This can lead to misallocating resources during well design, 
inefficient production strategies resulting in lost revenue, increased risk of 
wellbore damage, and poorly informed investment decisions. 
This research presents a data-driven hybrid 
approach that uses a Radial Basis 
Function Neural Network and a Particle Swarm Optimization 
algorithm to construct an automated hybrid machine learning model. 
The proposed model was compared with several well-established 
machine learning models in the literature using the same computational framework. 
The modeling results demonstrated the superiority of the hybrid approach. 
The model achieved superior performance with lower errors, as evidenced by a 
Relative Root Mean Squared Error (RRMSE) of 0.055. Furthermore, the model exhibited 
a low level of uncertainty throughout the analysis, indicating its high degree of 
reliability. These findings suggest the proposed data-driven approach offers a robust 
and practical solution for FBHP prediction in oil and gas wells.},

abstract={Designing drilling mud rheology is a complex task, particularly 
when it comes to preventing filter cakes from obstructing formation pores and 
making sure they can be easily decomposed using breakers. Incorporating both 
multiphysics and data-driven numerical simulations into the design of mud rheology 
experiments creates an additional challenge due to their symmetrical integration. 
In this computational intelligence study, we introduced numerical validation techniques 
using 498 available datasets from mud rheology and images from filter cakes. The goal was to 
symmetrically predict flow, maximize filtration volume, monitor void spaces, and evaluate 
formation damage occurrences. A neural-objective and image optimization approach to drilling 
mud rheology automation was employed using an artificial neural network feedforward (ANN-FF) 
function, a non-ANN-FF function, an image processing tool, and an objective optimization tool. 
These methods utilized the Google TensorFlow Sequential API-DNN architecture, MATLAB-nftool, 
the MATLAB-image processing tool, and a single-objective optimization algorithm. However, the 
analysis emanating from the ANN-FF and non-ANN-FF (with neurons of 10, 12, and 18) indicated that, 
unlike non-ANN-FF, ANN-FF obtained the highest correlation coefficient of 0.96–0.99. Also, 
the analysis of SBM and OBM image processing revealed a total void area of 1790 M µm2 and 1739 M µm2, 
respectively. Both SBM and OBM exhibited notable porosity and permeability that contributed to the 
enhancement of the flow index. Nonetheless, this study did reveal that the experimental-informed 
single objective analysis impeded the filtration volume; hence, it demonstrated potential formation damage. 
It is, therefore, consistent to note that automating flow predictions from mud rheology and filter 
cakes present an alternative intelligence method for non-programmers to optimize drilling productive time.},

abstract={Applications of nanotechnology are frequently used in the oil and gas sector. However, 
nanoparticles boost sand consolidation, lower interfacial tension between water and oil, 
and improve the mobility of trapped oil to increase crude oil recovery in enhanced 
petroleum recovery (EOR). Using aluminium PVP-coated low-porosity sand packing, the effects 
of nanoparticles on interfacial tension and water-oil surface contact were examined in this study. 
The horizontal column was filled with low-porosity sand, and the nanopowders were suspended in 
deionized water. The four distinct nanoparticle suspension pore volumes (PV) used in this 
experiment are 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 PV. At the column's output, the sample is then deposited, 
and the effluent is analysed and contrasted using IFT and viscosity with a solid viscometer. 
In this investigation, it was discovered that the water target zone had a very limited pore volume 
and only received 0.52 PV of injected nanoparticles. The better the oil can be extracted, the lower 
the viscosity and IFT value. The removal of the oil droplet and increased oil output for EOR could 
result from the transport of PVP nanoparticles coated with aluminium.},

abstract={Locating petroleum-productive wells using informed geological data, a conventional means, has proven to be 
tedious and undesirable by reservoir engineers. The former numerical simulator required a lengthy trial-and-error process 
to manipulate the variables and uncertainties that lie on the reservoir to determine the best placement of the well. Hence, 
this paper examines the use of a global genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize the placement of wells in complex reservoirs, 
rather than relying on gradient-based (GB) methods. This is because GB approaches are influenced by the solution’s surface 
gradient and may only reach local optima, as opposed to global optima. Complex reservoirs have rough surfaces with high 
uncertainties, which hinders the traditional gradient-based method from converging to global optima. The explicit focus of 
this study was to examine the impact of various initial well placement distributions, the number of random solution sizes 
and the crossover rate on cumulative oil production, the optimization of the synthetic reservoir model created by CMG Builder, 
CMOST, and IMEX indicated that using a greater number of random solutions led to an increase in cumulative oil production. 
Despite the successful optimization, more generations are required to reach the optimal solution, while the application of 
GA on our synthetic model has proven efficient for well placement; however, different optimization algorithms such as the 
improved particle swarm (PSO) and grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithms could be used to redefine well-placement optimization in CMG.},

abstract={The unproductive time is very high due to drill string jamming. So the main objective of this research 
is to determine the influences of the parameters in the accidents of stuck pipes using the construction of XGBoost models. 
To develop the model, drilling parameters are taken from daily drilling reports of the construction of 30 wells in the West 
Qurna field, Iraq. The data includes well drilling reports from 2013 to 2020. The results show that the factors such as 
Measured depth (MD), Rate of penetration (ROP), 10-sec gel (GEL1), Plastic Viscosity (PV), Mud weight (MW), Yield point 
(YP) contribute positively to the model predictions. In contrast, the factors such as Flow rate (FR), Rotation per minute (RPM), 
Filtrate (API/HPHT-FILTR and Bottom hole assembly (BHA) length has a negative contribution to the final model predictions. 
This research concluded that pipe sticking in the borehole is primarily due to inclination, penetration rate, and flow rate. 
This study is useful in the drilling of any field.},

drilling operators and engineers become curious about how drill bits react during rock breaking and penetration. 
Since it is experimentally expensive to determine, the goal of the study is to maximize the rate of penetration by modeling 
fluid interactions around the roller cone drilling bit (RCDB), specifying a suitable number of jet nozzles and venturi effects 
for non-Newtonian fluids (synthetic-based muds), and examining the effects of mud particles and drill cuttings. Ansys Fluent 
k-epsilon turbulence viscous model, a second order upwind for momentum, turbulent kinetic energy, and dissipation rate, were used 
to model the specified 1000 kg/m3 non-Newtonian fluid around the roller cone drill bit. The original geometry of the nozzles was 
adapted from a Chinese manufacturer whose tricone had three jet nozzles. The results of our six redesigned jet nozzles 
(3 outer, 39.12 mm, and 3 proximal, 20 mm) sought to offer maximum potential for drilling optimization. However, at a pressure

abstract={Several technical factors contribute to the flow of cuttings from the wellbore to the surface of the well, 
some of which are fundamentally due to the speed and inclination of the drill pipe at different positions (concentric and eccentric), 
the efficacy of the drilling mud considers plastic viscosity (PV) and yield point (YP), the weight of the cuttings, and the 
deviation of the well. Moreover, these overlaying cutting beds breed destruction in the drilling operation, some of 
which cause stuck pipes, reducing the rate of rotation and penetration. This current study, while it addresses the 
apropos of artificial intelligence (AI) with symmetry, employs a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulation model 
to validate an effective synthetic-based mud-drilling and to investigate the potency of the muds’ flow behaviours for transporting 
cuttings. Furthermore, the study examines the ratio effects of YP/PV to attain the safe transport of cuttings based on the turbulence 
of solid-particle suspension from the drilling fluid and the cuttings, and its velocity–pressure influence in a vertical well under 
a concentric and eccentric position of the drilling pipe. The resulting CFD analysis explains that the YP/PV of SBM and OBM, which 
generated the required capacity to suspend the cuttings to the surface, are symmetric to the experimental results and hence, 
the position of the drill pipe at the concentric position in vertical wells required a lower rotational speed. A computational 
study of the synthetic-based mud and its potency of not damaging the wellbore under an eccentric drill pipe position can be further 
examined.},

for computational fluid dynamic (CFD) validation. Matlab-CFD and Navier-Stokes equations aimed at predicting

breakers and drill-in-fluid such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), silica-nanoparticle (SiO2), and biodegradable 
synthetic-based mud drill-in-fluid (BSBMDIF) were monitored under a particle size distribution, viscosity, density, and

deposition created pore spaces between them; barite 74 μm, nano-silica 150 nm, and EDTA 10 μm generally closed up the pores of 
the filtration medium. Under extreme drilling conditions, barite formed thicker regions, and EDTA chemical properties easily 
disjointed these particles, while SiO2 entirely did not. The experimented results of (EDTA) and SiO2 for return permeability

abstract={Filter cake breakers are the means to remove filter cakes 
from the walls of the wellbore before completion and production. During drilling, 
there are layers of filter cakes formed that can’t easily be penetrated; these layers 
prevent drilling fluids from invading the formation or an influx of the formation fluid 
into the wellbore; fending of blowouts. Chemical breakers are difficult to optimize, and finding a 
reliable way to remove filter cakes from the wellbore in a uniform manner had been a singular difficulty for researchers. 
Some good engineers and operators in the industry incorrectly analyze the flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore, resulting in the designation of wells as redundant; this is due to the causes of layered filter cakes. The thesis study conducted a laboratory evaluation of several filter cake breakers using ethylene-diamine-tetra-acetic acid (EDTA), Silica dioxide (SiO2), Titanium dioxide (TiO2), and Graphene particles for better concentration optimization, and to determine how these organic acid and nanoparticles will react in a pressure, temperature regions. Also, the study formulated a biodegradable synthetic based mud drill-in-fluid (BSBMDIF) to create filter cakes using a replica of actual reservoir conditions. The methodology sought to formulate biodegradable synthetic based mud DIF which contained barite, bentonite, guar gum, caustic soda, calcium chloride, Sodium Tridecyl Ether Sulphate, graphene powder, water, and base oil, and the rheological parameters of the DIF were defined using an OFITE 900 viscometer, after which it passed the wellbore stability test. For the creation of filter cakes, HTHP filter press and Blue-M oven were utilized. Filter cakes build up in the BSBMDIF were subject to breakthrough, soaking, and injectivity tests, with the same amount of concentration measured in weights, the various filter cake breakers exhibited some level of efficiency. The organic acid, EDTA after treating filter cakes for 42 hours yielded an 80.98% efficiency, while the nanoparticles, especially Silica dioxide came close to reducing the weight of the filter cake by 69.13%. An increase in removal efficiency under this study was seen increasing the rate of return permeability, filter cakes that were treated with EDTA for 42 hours had a tremendous increase in return permeability by 74.89%, whiles graphene by contrast yielded slow permeability return by 52.97%. However, the nanoparticles under 
normal pressure and temperature maintained its physiochemical properties under a pressure of 100 to 500 psi and a temperature of 200℉.},

  abstract={Chelating agents such as Ethylene-Diamine-Tetra-Acetic 
(EDTA) had been suggested to be a newly designed biodegradable filter 
cake breakers that could enhance efficiency in filter cake removal. 
This chelate-based fluid had been proven to effectively dissolved 
the bridging agent in the filter cake which was calcium carbonate 
causing the removal of the filter cake to be successful. Besides 
that, the ability of the chelating agents to provide low corrosion 
potential made chelating agent as a great alternative for live mineral 
acids. This provided less aquatic toxicity, more human and environment 
friendly and readily. However, traditional EDTA cannot performance well 
in the high-pressure, high-temperature (HPHT) wellbore environments. 
Therefore, in this study, we explore the use of Titanium-enhanced 
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (Ti-EDTA) as a novel chemical breaker 
for the decomposition of filter cakes formed in high-pressure, 
high-temperature (HPHT) wellbore environments. Using ab initio 
molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations within the Quantum Espresso 
framework version 7.2, we examine the molecular interactions, atomic 
displacements, and thermodynamic behavior of Ti-EDTA in contact with 
synthetic-based mud (SBM) residues. The simulations track the structural 
evolution of Ti-EDTA during filter cake decomposition, revealing significant 
molecular rearrangements and enhanced solubility of the filter cakes. 
Compared to traditional EDTA-based and silica-based breakers, 
Ti-EDTA shows improved potential energy and particle mobility, 
indicative of greater decomposition efficiency. Our results indicate 
that EDTA resulted in a more negative potential energy of −1035 Ry 
signifying a stable system, whereas Ti-EDTA simulation yielded a 
less stable system with a value of −935 Ry energy. The atomic interactions 
at both levels indicated that Ti-EDTA possesses higher temperature by 
16000 K and with a coupled higher potential energy makes an effective 
chemical to enhance decomposition reactions. For a higher rate of 
potential energy, temperature and volume, Ti-EDTA molecule best beats 
EDTA in terms AIMD simulated efficiency. The integration of titanium 
ions into the EDTA structure significantly boosted the simulation 
performance, making it a promising candidate for environmentally 
friendly wellbore cleanup applications. The study provides insights 
into the molecular mechanisms driving filter cake degradation and 
sets the stage for future experimental validation of Ti-EDTA's 
efficacy in field operations.},
