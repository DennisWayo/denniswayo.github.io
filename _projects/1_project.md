This study explores the fundamental properties of fluorine-modified silica proppants for enhancing fracture conductivity in impermeable reservoirs. Proppants play a critical role in hydraulic fracturing by maintaining open fracture networks, which facilitate hydrocarbon flow. However, conventional proppants often face limitations in ultra-low permeability formations due to issues such as closure stress and chemical instability. To address these challenges, we investigate silica proppants modified with fluorine to enhance mechanical strength, thermal stability, and chemical resistance under high-stress reservoir conditions. The study involves a comprehensive analysis of the fluorine-silica interaction, including surface chemistry, structural integrity, and fluid compatibility. Experimental results and simulations provide insight into the modified proppantsâ€™ performance in extreme environments, highlighting their potential to improve fracture stability and extend the productive life of impermeable reservoirs. This work lays a foundation for the development of advanced proppant technologies tailored for challenging reservoir applications.
