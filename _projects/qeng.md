This review examines the scalability and fault tolerance of photonic and superconducting quantum processors, two leading platforms in the pursuit of practical quantum computing. Photonic processors offer the advantages of room-temperature operation and long coherence times, leveraging photons as robust carriers of quantum information, while superconducting processors, operating at cryogenic temperatures, provide high-speed operations and strong qubit-qubit interactions. Scalability remains a key challenge for both, as each faces limitations in qubit integration density and error rates. This work explores recent advances in circuit design, error correction, and materials engineering to address these challenges, assessing how each platform approaches fault tolerance and its implications for large-scale quantum computation. By analyzing the complementary strengths and technical hurdles of photonic and superconducting architectures, this review provides insight into the current state and future directions of scalable, fault-tolerant quantum processors, contributing to the development of resilient quantum computing systems.
