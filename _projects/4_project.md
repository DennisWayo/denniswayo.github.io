This study explores the optimization of filter cake removal using nanoparticles in Synthetic Based Mud Drill-In Fluid (SBMDIF) systems to enhance wellbore productivity and reduce formation damage. Filter cake, a byproduct of drilling fluids, often impairs fluid flow and impedes hydrocarbon production in the formation. Traditional removal techniques can be inefficient or damaging, particularly in challenging well conditions. In this work, nanoparticles were incorporated into SBMDIF to improve the breakdown and removal of filter cake, leveraging their high surface area and unique chemical properties. Laboratory experiments were conducted to assess nanoparticle performance in various SBMDIF compositions, analyzing factors such as particle concentration, size, and fluid compatibility. Results show that nanoparticles effectively penetrate and disrupt the filter cake matrix, significantly improving removal efficiency and reducing residual formation damage. This approach offers a promising solution for optimizing wellbore cleanup and enhancing post-drilling productivity, with potential applications in complex reservoir environments.
