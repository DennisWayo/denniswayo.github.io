**SchroSIM** is a hardware-agnostic simulator for photonic quantum circuits. It is designed for modeling both Gaussian and Fock-based gates, enabling research and experimentation with photonic quantum algorithms.

Built with Python, it supports **Strawberry Fields** and **PennyLane**, making it compatible with hybrid quantum-classical pipelines and variational quantum solvers.
