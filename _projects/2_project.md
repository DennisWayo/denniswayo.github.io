This study investigates nanointerface manipulation as a strategy to enhance light absorption and charge carrier separation in heterostructural photocatalysts for improved photocatalytic performance. In heterostructured systems, the interface between distinct materials plays a pivotal role in charge dynamics and light-matter interactions. By engineering the nanointerfaces, we aim to optimize energy band alignment, increase visible light absorption, and improve charge carrier migration across the interface, reducing recombination losses. Using advanced synthesis techniques and surface modifications, we tailored interfacial properties and analyzed their impact on photocatalytic activity through spectroscopy and electrochemical testing. Our findings reveal that tailored nanointerfaces effectively boost light harvesting and enhance photogenerated electron-hole separation, leading to significant improvements in photocatalytic efficiency. This work provides valuable insights into the design principles of next-generation heterostructural photocatalysts and lays the groundwork for applications in sustainable energy conversion and environmental remediation.
