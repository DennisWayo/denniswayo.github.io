This PhD thesis investigates a novel approach for CO₂ reduction by retrofitting wind turbines with a hybrid system of quantum dot-enhanced solid-state electrochemical cells. The study leverages quantum dot technology to enhance photon absorption and drive efficient electron transfer, aiming to increase the reaction rates for CO₂ reduction reactions (CO₂RR) under ambient conditions. By integrating the electrochemical cell into turbine structures, this approach utilizes wind energy not only for mechanical power but also as a sustainable power source for carbon capture and conversion. The thesis includes a comprehensive design analysis of hybrid quantum dot materials, focusing on optimizing band alignment and charge carrier dynamics to maximize CO₂RR efficiency. Experimental and simulated data are presented to validate the hybrid system’s performance, addressing challenges such as long-term stability, energy efficiency, and scalability. This work provides a pioneering framework for renewable-driven carbon reduction technologies, contributing to sustainable energy strategies for CO₂ management.
