"Dennis is a polymath and computational scientist with specialized skills in programming. He excels in developing robust classical and quantum machine learning algorithms using advanced numerical methods for scientific research and development. Currently, Dennis is a Researcher at the Laboratory of Renewable Energy, National Laboratory Astana. He is also pursuing a PhD in Chenical Engineering at the University of Malaysia Pahang, focusing on engineering intelligent materials. His research aims to enhance photon absorption using rare-earth ions and utilizes numerical doping techniques for designing photonic circuits, with applications in water splitting and carbon capture.

A passionate advocate for open-source software, Dennis is developing a device simulator for drift-diffusion and raytracing using Apple’s Swift programming language. His extensive expertise is demonstrated through his proficient use of MIT’s Electromagnetic Equation Propagation (MEEP) for numerical studies in photonic optical raytracing and his design of superconducting qubits with Qiskit-Metal. Dennis conducts simulations using Py4Vasp and Quantum Espresso for density functional theory and molecular dynamics, focusing on the electron, optical, and thermodynamic properties of materials. Additionally, he models and simulates fluid-structure interactions using OpenFoam, Ansys, and Comsol under finite element analysis (FEA) and discrete element method (DEM) techniques, while enhancing accuracy in oil and gas production predictions with CMG, Kappa, and Pipesim.

Further expanding his technical repertoire, Dennis develops quantum software with tools like Qiskit, TensorFlow Quantum, and Classiq, aimed at enhancing machine learning predictions on real datasets. His approach seamlessly integrates principles from fluid mechanics, geomechanics, quantum mechanics, and molecular mechanics, illustrating his broad expertise across multiple domains of physical science.
