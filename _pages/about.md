"Dennis is currently a research assistant at the National Laboratory Astana and a PhD candidate at universiti Malaysia Pahang where he's focused on blending cutting-edge classical and quantum machine learning algorithms coupled with fluid dynamics to develop innovative models which enhances fossil fuel, hydrogen production, and storage systems. Drawing on his extensive research background in both experimental and computational analysis, he excel at strategic R&D planning to drive optimization and progress in these critical energy sectors. The keywords that simply defines his academic prowess are quantum computing, photoelectrochemical cell for water and CO2 spliting, hydraulic fracturing. Also, his numerical approach emerges from fluid mechanics, geomechanics, quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics. Dennis! an exciting fellow.
