Dennis Wayo is a *computational scientist and quantum software researcher* with a multidisciplinary background in photonics, quantum computing, and intelligent materials design. He is currently completing his PhD in Chemical Engineering at the University Malaysia Pahang, where his work focuses on photon-activated rare-earth ion systems for sustainable energy applications, including water splitting and CO₂ capture.

Dennis specializes in developing quantum and classical machine learning frameworks, integrating advanced numerical methods and scientific computing to model physical phenomena. He is the creator of **SchroSIM**, a scalable simulator for photonic quantum circuits, and co-developer of **PiHOG**, a photon-informed hybrid optical graph neural network. He combines symbolic reasoning, graph theory, and deep learning to tackle complex problems across quantum mechanics, materials science, and energy systems.

His practical expertise spans DFT and TDDFT simulations using **Quantum ESPRESSO**, **GPAW**, and **Py4VASP**; finite element and multiphase modeling in **OpenFOAM**, **Ansys**, and **COMSOL**; and photonic simulations using **MEEP**. He has also designed superconducting qubit layouts using **Qiskit-Metal** and built quantum-classical hybrid pipelines with **PennyLane**, **Qiskit**, and **TensorFlow Quantum**.

Dennis advocates for open-source research, building Swift-based photonic device simulators and publishing on platforms such as Medium, Dev.to, and GitHub. His projects frequently incorporate **fluid mechanics, geomechanics, and quantum mechanics**, all tied together through his deep commitment to explainability and reproducibility in computational research.
