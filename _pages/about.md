"Dennis is a polymath and computational scientist with specialized skills in programming. He excels in developing robust classical and quantum machine learning algorithms using advanced numerical methods for scientific research and development. Currently, Dennis is a Researcher at the Laboratory of Renewable Energy, under the leadership of Professor Nuraje at the National Laboratory in Astana. He is also pursuing a PhD at the University of Malaysia Pahang, focusing on engineering intelligent materials. His research aims to enhance photon absorption using rare-earth ions and utilizes numerical doping techniques for designing photonic circuits, with applications in water splitting and carbon capture.

A passionate advocate for open-source software, Dennis is developing a device simulator for drift-diffusion and raytracing using Apple’s Swift programming language. His technical expertise includes:
	•	Proficient use of MIT’s Electromagnetic Equation Propagation (MEEP) for numerical studies in photonic optical raytracing.
	•	Designing superconducting qubits with Qiskit-Metal.
	•	Conducting simulations using Py4Vasp and Quantum Espresso for density functional theory and molecular dynamics, focusing on the electron, optical, and thermodynamic properties of materials.
	•	Modeling and simulating fluid-structure interactions using OpenFoam, Ansys, and Comsol under finite element analysis (FEA) and discrete element method (DEM) techniques.
	•	Enhancing accuracy in oil and gas production predictions with CMG, Kappa, and Pipesim.

Dennis has expanded his expertise to include developing quantum software with Qiskit, TensorFlow Quantum, and Classiq, aimed at enhancing machine learning predictions on real datasets. His comprehensive approach integrates fluid mechanics, geomechanics, quantum mechanics, and molecular mechanics, showcasing his extensive expertise across various physical sciences.
