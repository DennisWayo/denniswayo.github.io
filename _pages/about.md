"Dennis currently works as a research assistant at the National Laboratory Astana and is pursuing a PhD at Universiti Malaysia Pahang. His focus is on combining cutting-edge classical and quantum machine learning techniques with fluid dynamics to develop innovative models that enhance fossil fuel, hydrogen production, and storage systems. 

Leveraging his extensive research background in both experimental and computational analysis, he excels at strategic R&D planning to drive optimization and progress in these critical energy sectors. His academic expertise covers areas such as quantum computing, hydraulic fracturing, photoelectrochemical cells for water splitting and CO2 reduction. His numerical approach draws from fluid mechanics, geomechanics, quantum mechanics, and molecular mechanics. Dennis is an exciting research fellow.
