> Quantum Software • Photonic Architectures • Fault-Tolerant Systems

Dennis Wayo is a quantum computational scientist working at the interface of quantum software engineering, photonic architectures, fault tolerance, and large-scale simulation. His research integrates algorithm–hardware co-design with differentiable quantum programming, resource estimation, and error-aware modeling.

He is the creator of SchroSIM, a scalable quantum-photonic circuit simulator designed for Gaussian and non-Gaussian architectures, and lead developer of PhoQSim, a learning-augmented photonic compiler that integrates ML-surrogate models with nonlinear Schrödinger propagation and TDDFT-informed device physics. His work connects the physics of photonic hardware with compiler-level abstractions, a direction that aligns with current research in quantum error correction, MBQC-style cluster-state computation, and software frameworks for large-scale fault-tolerant systems.

Dennis is completing his PhD in Chemical Engineering at Universiti Malaysia Pahang, where he investigates photon activation in rare-earth ion systems and quantum optical models for chemical stability. In parallel, he is pursuing the Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) at the Georgia Institute of Technology with a focus on algorithms, systems, and quantum software. He also completed Princeton University’s specialization in Computer Architecture, deepening his understanding of cross-layer compiler/runtime design, a core requirement for emerging quantum architectures.

> His technical expertise includes:
- Quantum Simulation – TDDFT (GPAW), NLSE/SSFM photonics, MEEP-FDTD, Gaussian/non-Gaussian models 
- Quantum Software – PennyLane, Qiskit, photonic QNNs, QLS, VQE/ADAPT-VQE 
- Fault Tolerance – bosonic encodings, coherent-state codes, noise modeling, cluster-state intuition 
- Scientific ML – PINNs, GNNs, SHAP/XAI, symbolic-graph models 
- HPC & Systems – GPU pipelines, containerized workflows, distributed scientific computing

He has collaborated across disciplines spanning materials science, photonics, scientific ML, and quantum computing. His current research direction focuses on architecture-aware quantum software — the design of simulation, compilation, and resource estimation tools for scalable quantum systems, particularly in photonic and continuous-variable platforms.
