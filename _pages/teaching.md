#### üéì Quantum Computing Lessons (Udemy, 2025)

I am currently developing a **Quantum Computing Foundations** course on Udemy, tailored for students and professionals transitioning into the quantum technology space. The course includes both theoretical foundations and hands-on implementation using **Qiskit**, **PennyLane**, and **Strawberry Fields**.

##### Modules
- Qubits, Superposition, and Entanglement
- Quantum Gates and Circuits
- Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQE, QAOA)
- Introduction to Photonic Quantum Computing
- Hands-on: Qiskit, PennyLane, and Strawberry Fields
- Quantum Machine Learning for Spectral Analysis

> üì¢ Release planned for Summer 2025
