We just wrapped up an exciting and productive session at the **Asia Pacific Oil & Gas Conference and Exhibition (APOGCE) 2025** in Jakarta!

Inspired by the simplicity of a pregnancy test—where a single drop reveals vital information—we are developing a **Quantum-AI Toolkit** designed to predict whether chemical additives (e.g., EDTA–metal complexes) will remain stable under real-world wellbore conditions.

Think of it as a field-deployable screening method for evaluating the effectiveness of filter cake breakers **before costly field deployment**, seamlessly bridging simulation with operational decision-making.

Engaging discussions with **@Pertamina**, **@Sinomine Speciality Fluids**, and **@Archer Well** reaffirmed the importance of **collaboration between industry and academia** to drive innovation in the energy sector.
